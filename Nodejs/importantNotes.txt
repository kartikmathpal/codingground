                                            // NPM
                                            
1. To check npm installed or not
    npm --version
2. Installing Modules using NPM
    npm install <Module Name>         //eg: npm install express
3. Global vs Local Installation
    By default, NPM installs any dependency in the local mode. 
    Here local mode refers to the package installation in node_modules directory lying in the 
    folder where Node application is present. 
    Locally deployed packages are accessible via require() method.
    Use ' npm ls ' command to list down all the locally installed modules.
    Globally installed packages/dependencies are stored in system directory. 
    Such dependencies can be used in CLI (Command Line Interface) function of any node.js but 
    cannot be imported using require() in Node application directly.
    npm install <module name> -g   //to install globally
    npm ls -g  //to check modules installed globally
